# FAQ

## What is Bountycaster?

Bountycaster enables Farcaster users to post and discover bounties, jobs, or services. Bountycaster works with any Farcaster client.

## Who can post a bounty or service?

Farcaster accounts with a [power badge](https://warpcast.notion.site/Power-Badge-d81fea2e953e4dafae7c85295ffaf3ae) OR created before Farcaster went permissionless can post bounties or services (FID #20939 cutoff). Any user can also have their bounty (up to $250 amount) or service get posted if the cast gets likes from 2 power badge users. We'll expand this over time. You can contact @linda on Warpcast for a manual review if you don't meet this criteria.

## What payment types are supported?

We support USDC, ETH, degen, OP, $higher, NFT, $build, $farther, $HAM, $hunt, $berry, $COLORS, $tree, and MOXIE as payment. We also support negotiable amount bounties.

We support USDC for service posts.

## How do funds get paid out?

Funds are paid peer to peer. Payment details can be discussed between parties. Bountycaster only helps facilitate this process. On each bounty page, you can pay users directly on Base to their ENS or most recent Farcaster verified address. Addresses displayed on our site are compatible across all L2s (we filter for this attribute).

This feature acts as a guide. You can choose to confirm the address with the user directly, especially for larger amounts, but check that their address works for the chain/L2 you pay on (you can't assume this unless displayed on our site). Users can also add/update their verified address [through Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/~/settings/verified-addresses).

Payments should be made in a timely manner. Payments can also be made using tips if specified in the original post or the bounty completer is in agreement.

## How do I get funds to Base on my wallet?

Follow Base's [guide](https://docs.base.org/using-base/) to add it as a network if you don't have it set up in your wallet.

One of the cheapest options will be to purchase funds on Coinbase and send directly to your Base address (currently free to send). Please note our guided payment flow uses [Native USDC](https://www.circle.com/blog/usdc-now-available-natively-on-base) issued by Circle (token symbol: USDC).

## How do I add funds to someone else's bounty?

Tag @‌bountybot in the original bounty thread and write "add [amount and currency]"

*Example: @bountybot add 100 degen*

You can exclude the $ in degen to prevent a degen tip to the bounty poster.

The added amount needs to be in the same currency as the original bounty. We don't support adding funds to bounties that have more than 1 claim yet.

The original bounty poster will still make the decision on who gets the bounty funds, unless discussed separately.

## How do you handle disputes?

Transactions on Bountycaster are peer to peer so parties are expected to resolve disputes between themselves. If not possible, contact [support@bountycaster.xyz](mailto:support@bountycaster.xyz).

## How do I contact you?

*Example: 0.1 ETH for fixing this issue I'm running into [link] in the next 3 weeks. Please share any relevant background/experience and confirm with me first before working on this @bountybot*

You can only post 1 bounty max per thread.

### How do I manage my bounty?

You'll receive a daily update on all responses to your bounty from [@bountybot](https://warpcast.com/bountybot) as a direct cast. Follow @bountybot or check your "Requests" direct casts folder to see this update.

You can manage your bounty status, amount, or deadline through the Farcaster bounty frame "admin" button. Only the original bounty poster can manage the bounty. If you want to get more attention on your bounty, you can use the "Boost" button on the bounty frame.

We encourage marking your bounty as in progress once someone you want to work on the bounty picks it up. This removes the bounty from being listed as "Open Bounties" on Bountycaster, which helps avoid potential duplicate work.

If a user did an excellent job completing a bounty, you can write a shoutout that gets posted on their Bountycaster profile and helps build up reputation. Tag @bountybot in the original thread and write "shoutout [@username] [your statement]"

*Example: @bountybot shoutout @pirosb3 for doing a great job on this dev bounty*

## For bounty fulfillers:

### How do I indicate I'm working on a bounty?

Follow any instructions/criteria indicated by the bounty poster.

If the bounty doesn't involve any application criteria, it's helpful to reply to the original cast that you're working on the bounty so you can signal to others it's in progress and there's no duplicate work.

We're working on automating this process in the future.

### How do I ask the bounty poster questions?

Feel free to ask questions directly in the original thread since others might have the same question.

### How do I submit my bounty completion?

Follow any instructions/criteria indicated by the bounty poster. Otherwise reply in the original thread that you completed the bounty with proof of completion.

Once confirmed, the bounty poster will mark the bounty as complete.

Only the original bounty poster can mark the bounty as complete.
