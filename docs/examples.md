A: We don't charge for bounties but people can tip us if they would like otherwise we are trying to monetize through jobs

Q: If the bounty was paid through our website then there will be a transaction confirmation link posted in the bounty thread. Otherwise we don't get involved in verifying since bounties are peer to peer
A: Ohh what if someone will play it like they created a bounty who can create a frame for a degen tip. Someone delivered but the bounty creator did not pay the tip. Are there goin to be sunctions or any security implementations coming from the bountycast team?

Q: If no action is taken when confirmation is requested, will the status automatically change to something like "expired" after a certain period of time? Or will it just remain as it is?
A: Bounties expire after two weeks by default unless the bounty poster specifies a deadline
